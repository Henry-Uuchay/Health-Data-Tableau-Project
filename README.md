## 📘 Overview
This Tableau project uses the `GapminderHealth.csv` dataset to explore global trends in health, economic development, and population. The interactive dashboard visualizes key indicators such as life expectancy, GDP per capita, and child mortality across multiple countries and regions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Examine correlations between income and life expectancy
- Identify patterns in child mortality rates across time and continents
- Highlight progress and disparities in global health outcomes

## 📊 Visualizations Included
- **Life Expectancy vs. GDP per Capita Scatter Plot**: Reveals the relationship between wealth and longevity.
- **Child Mortality Over Time Line Chart**: Tracks improvements (or regressions) across countries.
- **Regional Comparisons via Map Visualization**: Provides a geographic view of health indicators.
- **Income Classification Breakdown**: Categorizes countries based on economic status and shows associated health metrics.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Countries with higher GDP per capita generally report higher life expectancies.
- Child mortality rates have declined globally, but not uniformly.
- Geographic and income-based disparities remain significant in certain regions.
